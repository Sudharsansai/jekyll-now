I am **Sudharsan**, a Computer Science Graduate student at UCLA. My area of interest is Machine Learning and associated fields. I have been working on Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision for a while now. My goal is to unite these two avenues to design an AI Complete system. The particular difficulty in modelling real-world phenomena using various mathematical models is what I admire the most in Machine Learning. This blog is a stream to channel my thoughts and views on various avenues of Machine Learning. During my brief-tenure as a research intern at IBM-Research Labs, I worked on conversation modeling. The goal was to predict the 'success' of conversations happening at tech-support forums. While I was interning at Microsoft, I was into the Relevance and Revenue team of Bing Ads. There, I was working on the 'cold start' problem for online advertising. I did my Btech at Indian Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar, India. For my Btech Thesis, I worked on a Computer Vision problem. I love coding and problem-solving. I like playing tennis, chess and cricket. My hobbies include reading, drawing and solving rubik's cube!
